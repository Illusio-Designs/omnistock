# Channel Roadmap

This file tracks the **115 channels** that have adapter code in the backend
but are flagged `comingSoon: true` because they have **not been smoke-tested
against live seller credentials yet**.

The public stats endpoint (`/api/v1/public/stats`) excludes them from
`channelsCount` and reports them separately as `comingSoonCount`.

## How to "make a channel work"

For each entry below, the work to flip `comingSoon: false` is:

1. **Get a sandbox/test seller account** for the platform (most require approval).
2. **Locate the adapter** at `backend/src/services/channels/<category>/pending.js`
   (or the dedicated file if one exists).
3. **Smoke test** the four core methods against the sandbox:
   - `testConnection()` — auth handshake
   - `fetchOrders(sinceDate)` — pull recent orders
   - `updateInventoryLevel(sku, qty)` — push stock
   - `fetchTracking(orderId)` (logistics only)
4. **Fix any drift** between the adapter's assumptions and the platform's actual response shape (specs lie; production payloads are the source of truth).
5. **Remove `comingSoon: true`** from the catalog entry in
   `backend/src/data/channel-catalog.js`.
6. **Add a smoke-test fixture** to `backend/src/scripts/test.js` (recorded
   response, redacted creds) so regressions are caught.

When all checkboxes in a category are ticked, update [docs/CHANNELS.md](CHANNELS.md)
to drop the "coming soon" annotation.

### Notes on the 🟡 batch

- **Walmart** — adapter rewritten with founder-app OAuth (Solution Provider `client_credentials` grant). Sellers paste only `partnerId` + region; platform-wide `walmart.clientId` / `walmart.clientSecret` live in Admin → Settings. **Needs:** register a Walmart Solution Provider app and a sandbox seller account to smoke-test.
- **Amazon US/UK/UAE/SA/SG/AU/DE** — Amazon SP-API adapter is region-aware (21-region marketplace-ID + endpoint table). All AMAZON_<REGION> variants reuse the platform's `amazon.appId` / `amazon.clientId` / `amazon.clientSecret`; sellers don't paste secrets. OAuth start route infers region from the channel type. **Needs:** SP-API app must include the matching region group (NA for US; EU for UK/UAE/SA/DE; FE for SG/AU); then smoke-test against a sandbox seller in each marketplace.
- **Lazada** — full Lazada Open Platform adapter rewritten in `services/channels/ecom/lazada.js`: HMAC-SHA256 request signing (the previous code never actually computed a signature, so every API call was rejected), region-aware host map for SG/TH/PH/MY/VN/ID, paginated `fetchOrders`, XML-payload inventory updates, OAuth `/oauth/lazada/start` + `/oauth/lazada/callback` routes, and `refreshAccessToken` for the 30-day refresh token. Founder-app pattern: `lazada.appKey` / `lazada.appSecret` / `lazada.redirectUri` live in Admin → Settings; sellers only pick a country and click Authorize. **Needs:** register a Lazada Open Platform app at https://open.lazada.com/apps, then smoke-test against any one country's sandbox seller (the same code path serves all six markets).
- **Shopee** — full Shopee Open Platform adapter in `services/channels/ecom/shopee.js`: HMAC-SHA256 request signing for both shop-scoped and public endpoints (the previous code skipped signing entirely, so every API call was rejected), country picker covering 12 markets (SG/MY/TH/ID/VN/PH/TW/BR/MX/CO/CL/PL), paginated `fetchOrders` with cursor-based loop and a follow-up `get_order_detail` hydration call to populate items + addresses + totals, `update_stock` adapter via skuMap, `exchangeAuthCode` + `refreshAccessToken` for the 4h access / 30-day refresh tokens. OAuth `/oauth/shopee/start` builds a signed `auth_partner` URL; `/oauth/shopee/callback` receives `code` + `shop_id` and persists tokens encrypted. Founder-app: `shopee.partnerId` / `shopee.partnerKey` / `shopee.redirectUri` live in Admin → Settings. **Needs:** register a Shopee Open Platform app at https://open.shopee.com (one app covers all markets), set the redirect URI to match Admin → Settings, then smoke-test against any one market's sandbox shop.
- **Noon** — per-merchant API key (no founder app). Adapter in `services/channels/ecom/noon.js`: real `testConnection` against `/v1/partner/me`, paginated `fetchOrders` with `country_code` scoping, `updateInventoryLevel` + `updateListing`. Country picker covers AE/SA/EG. Sellers paste their own apiKey + partnerCode from Noon Partners → Settings → API. **Needs:** smoke-test against a Noon merchant account in any one country (the same code path serves all three).
- **Mercado Libre** — full LATAM founder-app OAuth in `services/channels/ecom/mercado-libre.js`. Multi-region consent host map (8 markets: AR/BR/MX/CL/CO/UY/PE/VE; same `api.mercadolibre.com` for all). Per-tenant access_token (6h) + single-use refresh_token + numeric user_id; `_ensureAccessToken` auto-refreshes on expiry. Paginated `fetchOrders` with offset/limit; `updateInventoryLevel` via skuMap → item_id. OAuth `/oauth/mercadolibre/start` (region-specific consent host) + `/oauth/mercadolibre/callback` (exchange code for tokens, persist user_id). Founder-app: `mercadolibre.clientId` / `mercadolibre.clientSecret` / `mercadolibre.redirectUri` in Admin → Settings — one app covers all 8 markets. **Needs:** register a Mercado Libre app at https://developers.mercadolibre.com, then smoke-test against any one market's seller account.
- **Allegro** — full Allegro founder-app OAuth in `services/channels/ecom/allegro.js`. Authorization Code Grant against `allegro.pl/auth/oauth` with Basic-auth token exchange; sandbox-aware (allegro.pl.allegrosandbox.pl). 12h access_token + sliding refresh_token, `_ensureAccessToken` auto-refresh, vendor media-type headers (`application/vnd.allegro.public.v1+json`). Paginated `fetchOrders` against `/order/checkout-forms` (READY_FOR_PROCESSING + NEW fulfillment). `updateInventoryLevel` PATCH against `/sale/product-offers` with skuMap → offerId or external.id filter. OAuth `/oauth/allegro/start` (sandbox toggle) + `/oauth/allegro/callback`. Founder-app: `allegro.clientId` / `allegro.clientSecret` / `allegro.redirectUri` in Admin → Settings. **Needs:** register an Allegro app at https://apps.developer.allegro.pl, then smoke-test in sandbox first, then flip to production.
- **Fruugo** — per-merchant HTTP Basic auth (no founder app). Adapter in `services/channels/ecom/fruugo.js`: real `testConnection` against `/api/orders/new` (size=0 to avoid pulling data), paginated `fetchOrders`, `acknowledgeOrder` to dequeue from /new feed, `updateInventoryLevel` + `updateListing`, full `makeOrderShape` transforms with delivery-address + line-item handling. Sellers paste their own username + password from the Fruugo merchant dashboard. **Needs:** smoke-test against a Fruugo merchant account.
- **OnBuy** — per-seller credentials with managed access tokens (no founder app). Adapter in `services/channels/ecom/onbuy.js`: exchanges `consumer_key + secret_key` for a 1-hour `access_token` via `/v2/auth/request-token`, caches and auto-refreshes. Site-aware (defaults to OnBuy GB `2000`, with European sites 2001–2005 selectable). Paginated `fetchOrders`, `updateInventoryLevel`, `updateListing` via skuMap. Sellers paste consumerKey + secretKey from their OnBuy seller account. **Needs:** smoke-test against an OnBuy seller account.
- **ManoMano** — per-seller API token (no founder app). Adapter in `services/channels/ecom/manomano.js`: bearer auth + `X-Mano-Country` header to scope calls to the chosen marketplace. 6-country picker (FR/UK/DE/IT/ES/BE). Real `testConnection` against `/api/v2/seller/me`, paginated `fetchOrders`, `updateInventoryLevel`, `updateListing`, full `makeOrderShape` transforms. **Needs:** smoke-test against a ManoMano seller account.
- **Rakuten Ichiba** — per-seller RMS credentials (no founder app). Adapter in `services/channels/ecom/rakuten.js`: ESA-scheme auth (base64-encoded `serviceSecret:licenseKey` in the Authorization header). Two-step order pull (`searchOrder` → `getOrder` in 50-order chunks) which is how RMS actually works (the previous adapter only pulled order numbers and never hydrated). Real `testConnection` via lightweight searchOrder probe, `updateInventoryLevel` with proper inventoryType + overwrite operation, full transform incl. Japanese postal codes (`zipCode1-zipCode2`). **Needs:** smoke-test against a Rakuten Ichiba seller account.
- **Zalando** — per-merchant zDirect client_credentials (no founder app). Adapter in `services/channels/ecom/zalando.js`: corrected host to `api.merchants.zalandoapis.com` (the previous code pointed at a non-existent `api-merchant.zalando.com/orders` endpoint), real client_credentials → bearer token exchange with caching + auto-refresh, paginated `fetchOrders` against `/merchants/{id}/orders`, `updateInventoryLevel` and `updateListing` (price + qty) per Zalando's article endpoints. Sellers paste clientId + clientSecret + merchantId. **Needs:** smoke-test against a zDirect merchant account.
- **Kaufland** — per-merchant credentials with HMAC-SHA256 request signing (no founder app). Adapter in `services/channels/ecom/kaufland.js`: **fixes a critical security bug** — the previous adapter sent `Shop-Secret-Key` as an HTTP header (the secret should never travel over the wire); the rewrite signs `METHOD\nURI\nBODY\nTIMESTAMP` locally and only sends `Shop-Client-Key` + `Shop-Timestamp` + `Shop-Signature`. Also fixes a separate bug where `storefront` was an arrow function literal serialised as `[object Function]` in the query string. 6-storefront picker (DE/AT/SK/CZ/PL/HR), paginated `fetchOrders`, `updateInventoryLevel` + `updateListing` via PATCH /units. **Needs:** smoke-test against a Kaufland Seller Center merchant account.
- **Wish** — founder-app OAuth in `services/channels/ecom/wish.js`. Authorization Code Grant against merchant.wish.com; `_ensureAccessToken` auto-refreshes the 30-day access_token before expiry. Paginated `fetchOrders`, `updateInventoryLevel`, `updateListing` (price + qty + name). OAuth `/oauth/wish/start` + `/oauth/wish/callback`. Founder-app: `wish.clientId` / `wish.clientSecret` / `wish.redirectUri` in Admin → Settings. **Needs:** register a Wish Merchant Platform app at https://merchant.wish.com/api-partner, then smoke-test against a Wish merchant account.
