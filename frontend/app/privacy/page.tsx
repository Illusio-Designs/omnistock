              <p>We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide our services. When you delete your account from <strong>Settings &rarr; Security &rarr; Delete my account</strong>:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-3">
                <li><strong>Login is disabled at once</strong> — both password and Google sign-in stop working immediately, and your workspace status is set to DELETED so the team loses access.</li>
                <li><strong>30-day recovery window</strong> — your name, email, and phone are kept on file for 30 days so you can ask us to undo the deletion if you change your mind.

                <li><strong>Business records are retained</strong> — invoices, orders, audit logs, and tax-relevant documents are preserved as required by Indian GST and accounting regulations (typically 8 years). They&apos;re <em>de-linked from your personal identifiers</em> but remain in our records to satisfy legal and audit obligations.</li>
                <li><strong>You can request a full erasure</strong> in writing to <a href="mailto:privacy@kartriq.com" className="text-emerald-600 hover:underline">privacy@kartriq.com</a> at any time — we&apos;ll review against our legal retention duties and respond within 30 days.</li>
